## Known Issues and Limitations

### Current Issues 🐛

**TypeScript Migration**

- 🐛 Manual `.d.ts` files still need replacement with generated declarations
- 🐛 Import path updates from `.mjs` to `.js` need verification
- 🐛 Some complex modules may need refactoring for TypeScript compatibility

**Browser Compatibility**

- 🐛 Safari OPFS support is incomplete (limiting factor for cross-browser compatibility)
- 🐛 Firefox SharedArrayBuffer requires specific security headers
- 🐛 Memory growth limitations on some mobile browsers

**Performance**

- 🐛 Small query overhead can be significant for very simple operations
- 🐛 OPFS random access performance needs optimization
- 🐛 Memory usage can grow during long-running operations

### Limitations ⚠️

**Platform Limitations**

- ⚠️ No Node.js support (browser-only focus)
- ⚠️ Requires HTTPS or localhost for SharedArrayBuffer
- ⚠️ Dependent on browser WebAssembly implementation quality
- ⚠️ Memory limits subject to browser constraints

**API Limitations**

- ⚠️ No multi-threaded query execution (single WebAssembly instance)
- ⚠️ Limited concurrent database access (single connection per WebAssembly instance)
- ⚠️ WebAssembly instantiation time can be noticeable for first use
- ⚠️ File size of WebAssembly binary (~2.5MB compressed)
