# Releases (Versioned Migrations)

Releases let you evolve your schema and seed data on the client in a predictable,
versioned way. Each release is immutable and identified by a semantic version
string (`x.x.x` with no leading zeros). The library stores release metadata in a
separate SQLite file and keeps a historical database copy for every version.

## Usage

### 1) Declare immutable releases at startup

```ts
import openDB from "web-sqlite-js";

const db = await openDB("demo.sqlite3", {
    releases: [
        {
            version: "0.0.0",
            migrationSQL:
                "CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);",
            seedSQL: "INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Ada');",
        },
        {
            version: "0.0.1",
            migrationSQL: "ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN created_at TEXT;",
        },
    ],
});
```

## Validation rules

- Versions must follow `x.x.x` with no leading zeros (for example: `0.0.1`).
- Versions in `releases` must be strictly increasing and unique.
- The version name `default` is reserved and cannot be used in `releases`.
- Archived release rows must be declared in `releases` and their hashes must
  match the stored metadata.
- New versions must be greater than the latest version in metadata.
- `devTool.rollback()` cannot roll back below the latest **release** version.

## Behavior notes

- The latest version (release or dev) is always opened as the active database.
- Migration + seed SQL run inside a single transaction.
- Failed releases clean up their version directory and do not update metadata.
- SHA-256 is used to hash `migrationSQL` and `seedSQL` for immutability checks.

## OPFS layout

When you open a database named `demo.sqlite3`, OPFS will look like this:

```
demo.sqlite3/
  release.sqlite3
  default.sqlite3
  0.0.0/
    db.sqlite3
    migration.sql
    seed.sql
  0.0.1/
    db.sqlite3
    migration.sql
```

Notes:

- `release.sqlite3` stores release metadata (version, hashes, mode, timestamp).
- `default.sqlite3` is the system-generated base version (`default`).
- Each release version gets its own `db.sqlite3`, plus `migration.sql` and
  optional `seed.sql` files.
