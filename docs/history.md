## Timeline Highlights

- `6243052` – Imported the upstream SQLite WASM core, establishing the baseline Emscripten build inside the repository.
- `010b16c` – Extracted bootstrap logic into standalone modules, starting the long-running push toward a maintainable runtime layout.
- `850fbed` & `6351ee1` – Split OPFS-specific logic from `sqlite3Apibootstrap.mjs` into dedicated installers and SAH pool helpers, paving the way for the current persistence architecture.
- `7b3327f` & `c0c4923` – Refactored the async proxy worker to keep synchronized with upstream changes while preserving local customizations.
- `6733376` – Added type declarations for the legacy OPFS proxy to keep TypeScript parity with the worker implementation.
- `7fbc0d7` – Documented and verified the wasm utilities API while adding helper modules (`heap-helpers`, `memory-helpers`, etc.) to support new TypeScript definitions.
- `8749690` – Synchronized API documentation and `.d.ts` files, clarifying how the OO1, worker, and wasm utility layers interact.

## Current State

The runtime now ships as a collection of focused modules (`runtime`, `utils`, `vfs`, `api`) with comprehensive TypeScript definitions and a worker-driven regression harness. Documentation mirrors that structure so maintainers can trace behaviors back to their implementation files quickly.【F:docs/index.md†L5-L35】【F:docs/modules/runtime.md†L5-L33】

## Near-Term Goals

- Finish the TypeScript conversion by replacing remaining `.mjs` sources with `.mts` equivalents while keeping ESM output stable.
- Automate the browser-based verification harness in CI so OPFS regressions surface without manual review.【F:docs/development/testing.md†L21-L36】
- Continue pruning documentation to reflect repository reality as new modules move from `.mjs` to `.mts`.
